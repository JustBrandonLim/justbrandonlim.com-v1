Hi everyone. About a week ago, my good friend [Rick](https://rickkoh.github.io) recommended me to
take a look at Gatsby. Soon enough, I was already building this [site](/) as a replacement for my old
portfolio site written in vanilla HTML5 and JavaScript with Bootstrap 5.

## The good

Being new to `Gatsby`, there are plenty of tutorials and documentation for me to reference from. I feel that
there isn't a steep learning curve to `Gatsby` (or `React`) as compared to other programming languages such
as `C` or `C++`.

#### `Gatsby Starters`

`Gatsby` has a whole bunch of boilerplaters called `Gatsby Starters` to allow you to jump right into creating
web applications quickly. I used a few of them, such as `gatsby-starter-blog` as a reference to build this
blog of mine.

#### `Gatsby Plugins`

Like `Gatsby Starters`, `Gatsby` also has a bunch of plugins that make your life easier while developing with
`Gatsby`. There are many useful plugins which I personally used to create this website of mine such as
`gatsby-plugin-mdx` which is allows you to write `JSX` embedded inside markdown.

## The bad

Although I am relatively new to web development (less than 2 years of experience), I feel that there
isn't much that I can complain about `Gatsby`.

#### `gatsby-remark-images`

Although it parses the images from MD/MDX through image sharp, the options available are not much. To me,
it also seems like it looks a bit different from `gatsby-plugin-image`. I would prefer consistency with
`gatsby-plugin-image` in my opinion.

## Summary

Overall, Gatsby is an amazing framework, as it combines the power of React while providing good
Search Engine Optimization features. It is blazingly fast and allows you to maintain the "Single Page Application"
feel.
