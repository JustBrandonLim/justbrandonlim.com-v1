About a week ago, my good friend of 10 years, Rick,
recommended me to a JavaScript framework called Gatsby. Due to my curiousity,
I immediately went to take a look at Gatsby and websites that were built with it.
I soon realized that all the websites are blazingly fast for some unknown reason.

With Gatsby having caught my interest, I went to research further and learnt
that its a static site generator. Gatsby has a few amazing features that
ultimately led to me creating this [portfolio](/) of mine with it.

The portfolio was meant to be a learning project for me to learn Gatsby and
React as well as a showcase of my portfolio to my future employers.

### Features of Gatsby

1. React for building pages and components.
2. GraphQL for its data layer.
3. Many useful plugins such as gatsby-plugin-image that supports lazy
   loading of images and using Sharp to transform images.

### Reasons for using Gatsby

1. Static pages are compiled at build time before deployment which makes
   sites built with it blazingly fast as they are not rendered on the
   server.
2. Static files are fully rendered which makes
   it good for Search Engine Optimization as the crawlers do not see an empty
   page.
3. It is easy to update as it uses React components to build the site.
4. There are a lot of available boilerplates and documentations.
5. Speed is priority.

### Relevant links for Gatsby

I have attached a few links that I thought might help with your development
if you are interested in creating sites with Gatsby!

1. [What is a Static Site Generator?][1] is a useful 10 minute video explaining
   Gatsby and is a part of a 22 episode tutorial on building a site and blog
   with it.
2. [Gatsby Way of Building][2] is Gatsby's official documentation, which I
   strongly recommend to read first to learn more about their best practices.
3. [Gatsby Starter Library][3] is where all of Gatsby Starters (also known
   as boilerplates) are located. You can quickly build a working site in
   minutes with it.
4. [Gatsby Plugin Library][4] is where you can look for useful plugins that
   supports Gatsby.

### Summary

This entire website is created in Gatsby by me along with React-Bootstrap.
I hope that you will have explored and enjoyed my portfolio.

Of course, if you are interested in my website's source code, it is
available [here](https://github.com/JustBrandonLim/JustBrandonLim-Portfolio)
